# Context Engineering 101 for SREs

A practical guide to working effectively with AI coding assistants like Codex and Claude Code.

## What is Context Engineering?

Context Engineering is the practice of providing AI assistants with the right information, in the right format, so they can help you accomplish tasks effectively. It's not about writing clever prompts—it's about building systems that give the AI everything it needs to understand your work.

## Course Structure

This training consists of seven modules designed for SRE teams:

1. **[Core Concepts](01-core-concepts.md)** - The four context strategies and foundational principles
2. **[Filesystem Organization](02-filesystem-organization.md)** - Using your directory structure as context architecture
3. **[Multi-Tab Orchestration](03-multi-tab-orchestration.md)** - Managing multiple specialized agents
4. **[Local Data Stores](04-local-data-stores.md)** - Building searchable inventories and references
5. **[Integration Patterns](05-integration-patterns.md)** - When to use live queries vs. local data
6. **[Practical Patterns](06-practical-patterns.md)** - Real-world workflows and examples
7. **[Common Pitfalls](07-common-pitfalls.md)** - What to avoid and how to fix it

## Quick Start

If you're new to AI-assisted development:

1. Read **Core Concepts** to understand the fundamentals
2. Try the exercises in **Filesystem Organization**
3. Practice with a real task using **Practical Patterns**

If you're already using AI assistants:

1. Jump to **Multi-Tab Orchestration** to level up your workflow
2. Explore **Local Data Stores** to build better context infrastructure
3. Review **Common Pitfalls** to avoid typical mistakes

## Key Takeaways

- **Stop writing prompts, start engineering context** - Give the AI what it needs to succeed
- **One agent, one job** - Use multiple tabs for complex tasks
- **Your filesystem is your context** - Organize logically and start sessions in the right place
- **Build searchable ground truth** - Create local inventories for repeated queries
- **Tokens are cheap, clarity is expensive** - Use isolation over compression

## Prerequisites

- Familiarity with command-line tools
- Experience with git, kubernetes, terraform, or similar infrastructure tools
- Access to Codex, Claude Code, or similar AI coding assistant

## Time Commitment

- **Core workshop**: 3 hours (modules 1-3)
- **Full course**: 5-6 hours (all modules)
- **Ongoing practice**: Apply to daily work

## Additional Resources

- [Quick Reference Card](quick-reference.md) - One-page cheat sheet
- [Workshop Exercises](workshop-exercises.md) - Hands-on practice activities
- [Example Prompts](example-prompts.md) - Copy-paste starting points
